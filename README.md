# Burger App

This is a fun app that displays burger names from a MySQL database. If you click on the "Hungry?" button, it changes the status of the burger to "eaten" and moves it to a seperate list. The status is also changed in MySQL. 

### Features:

This utilizes node, mysql, and the final project is deployed on heroku.
